      <p>This fettuccine carbonara is a delectable, mouth-watering pile of yummy goodness! I recommend a nice salad with it — that's all you will need for a complete meal.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>5 teaspoons olive oil
              <li>4 shallots, diced
              <li>1 pound bacon, cut into strips
              <li>1 large onion, cut into thin strips
              <li>1 clove garlic, chopped    
              <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry fettuccine pasta
              <li>¾ cup shredded Parmesan cheese
              <li>½ cup heavy cream
              <li>3 egg yolks
              <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Steps:</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>Heat olive oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Sauté shallots until softened. Stir in bacon and onion; cook and stir until bacon is evenly browned. Stir in garlic when bacon is about half done. Remove from heat.</li>
              <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain pasta, then return it to the pot.</li>
              <li>Whisk Parmesan, cream, and egg yolks together in a medium bowl. Pour bacon mixture over pasta; stir in cream mixture. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
